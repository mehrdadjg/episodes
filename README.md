## Intro
I used to use IMDb's eprate/epdate page everyday. They decided to shut it down a couple of days ago and so I had to do something. I wrote this small app to replace what IMDb took away.

It is much slower than the real thing -- I don't have access to IMDb's database, I just load pages and extract information and a show like The Simpsons has a ton of pages! Please be patient.

There could be bugs since I haven't had the time to completely test the application yet. Please let [me](mailto:mehrdadjg@gmail.com) know if there are any flaws.

## Installation
Well, there is a file named [*ep.py*](ep.py) in this project. Copy and paste that file into your computer. You will also need to install the latest (or any version later than 3.6.3) of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your computer.

**Note**: If you are using windows, please add python to your PATH variable. There is a check mark when you are installing the application that does this.

Once you have done all that, open your command line in the directory you have copied *ep.py* (use command line's `cd`) and then type `py ep.py rate Suits "Game of Thrones"`.

## Contribution
I'd welcome anyone who wants to contribute to this project. If there are enough contributers maybe IMDb will decide to bring this feature back.
